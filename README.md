Hi, Best Korea here, a lot of people already know about this, so I will share for everyone else who still don't know, or don't know how.  

If you want to zoom out all you have to do is copy and paste on your address bar of your Airmash tab:

`javascript:(()=>{config.scalingFactor = 3500;Graphics.resizeRenderer(window.innerWidth,window.innerHeight);})()`

**Be careful that the browser may remove the "javascript:" when you paste**, so type it again if this happen.

A good tip is that you can create a Bookmark with this as its url, and clicking on the bookmark will activate the scaling.
